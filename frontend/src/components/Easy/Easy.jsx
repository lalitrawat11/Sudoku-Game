        Easy Sudoku is characterized by the fact that cells contain more numbers
        than medium or hard ones. It makes this game suitable for beginners and
        those who have never played Sudoku before. Sudoku is one of the most
        popular games to develop your intelligence. Supposedly, it was invented
        in 1970 by Dell's puzzler in New York, who published it in his journal
        “Mathematical Puzzles and Logical Problems”. The further development to
        web Sudoku was held in Japan, where the name of the game was invented.
        In 2004, Sudoku was first published in the “Times” as an online game.
        Easy Sudoku puzzles not only bring pleasure, but also train
        concentration and attention. You will notice how quickly your ability to
        concentrate improves, if you play daily. It is especially useful to play

        their mental abilities for many years. If you have never played this

      <h2 className="Headings">How to play beginner Sudoku puzzles?</h2>
      <p className="Para">
        The goal of Sudoku is to fill the cells with numbers from 1 to 9. The
        numbers are placed in 9 squares, 3x3 each, thus, in each row, in each
        column and in each small square there are 9 cells. The same digit can be
        used only once in each separate column, each line and in each small
        square. The level of difficulty depends on how many digits are already
        indicated in the cells. If you open plenty of numbers - then you have
        very easy Sudoku.
