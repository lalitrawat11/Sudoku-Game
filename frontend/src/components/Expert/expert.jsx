      <h2 className="Headings">How to solve Extreme Sudoku puzzles?</h2>
      <p className="Para">
        The basic rule, which applies to all Sudoku difficulty levels, is that
        each digit from 1 to 9 can appear only once in each row, column, and 3Ã—3
        block. To win Sudoku, you must complete all the numbers on the Sudoku
        grid. But cracking an extremely difficult Sudoku requires more than just
        following basic rules. It demands a deep understanding of solving
        strategies such as X-Wing and Swordfish because initially there are
        practically no digits on your playing field. These advanced strategies
        involve identifying specific patterns within the puzzle grid, which can
        be utilized to deduce the placement of certain numbers. Here are five
        tips to help you handle the extreme Sudoku levels:
        <ol className="List">
          <li>
            Create Candidate Lists: keep track of the possible candidates for
            each cell. As you eliminate possibilities, update the candidate
            lists accordingly. This can help you visualize the available options
            and spot patterns more easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus on the Overlapping Regions: extremely hard Sudoku puzzles
            often have regions where multiple constraints overlap, such as rows
            or columns where two or more blocks intersect. Pay close attention
            to these areas as they can provide valuable clues for solving the
            puzzle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Look for Symmetry: extreme Sudoku puzzles sometimes feature
            symmetrical patterns or arrangements of numbers. Identifying and
            leveraging these symmetries can provide valuable insights into the
            solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice Visualization: train your mind to visualize the
            implications of placing a certain number in a particular cell. This
            skill can help you anticipate potential conflicts or patterns that
            may emerge later in the puzzle
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay Organized: Keep your solving process organized and systematic.
            Avoid making random guesses and ensure that each step you take is
            based on logical deductions and patterns.
          </li>
        </ol>
